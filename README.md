# PyTorch Basics

This repository is an introduction to the basic operations in PyTorch, including tensor initialization, mathematical operations, matrix operations, and conversions between NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors.

## Description

The repository contains a Jupyter notebook and a Python script demonstrating various PyTorch functionalities, such as:

- Initializing one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional tensors
- Performing random initialization of tensors
- Executing basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Conducting matrix operations and transformations
- Reshaping tensors
- Converting between NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors
- Checking for GPU availability and performing tensor operations on the CPU
